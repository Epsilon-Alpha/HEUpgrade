# HEUpgrade
This script will help you upgrade all your servers' CPU and HDD to maximum configuration (i.e 4GHz and 10GB SSD) in Hacker Experience.

### Intro
This is the first script I've ever written, so please bear with it as it doesn't have any interface, let alone a fancy one.
This took me a couple of days of googling and understanding how to handle redirections with the page, and send postdata.
I hope you guys find it useful!

### Prerequisites
All you need is a Userscript manager like ***Greasemonkey*** (for Firefox) or ___Tampermonkey___ (for Chrome).

### Installing
To install, click [here!](https://github.com/Epsilon-Alpha/heupgrade/raw/master/HEUpgrade.user.js)
Once installed, edit it to change ENTERACCOUNTNUMBER to your bank account number ***(without the #)*** which will be used to buy the servers. Don't worry, this is safe as pie because no data is being sent anywhere.

### Usage
Go to the Hardware tab, turn on the script, and refresh!
